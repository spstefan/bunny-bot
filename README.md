# bunny-bot
A Discord bot offering daily mood tracking and visual charting of users' mood over time. 


BunnyBot sends a message at set time every day asking users to report their mood using reactions. At midnight, the reactions are tallied up and saved to a file. Using this data, the bot can create visualisations with Altair which users can retrieve with a command. 


## Todo:
- Implement reactions to daily message
- Save and store reactions at the end of the day
- Data visualisation
- Update README
